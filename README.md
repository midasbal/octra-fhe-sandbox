Octra FHE Terminal & Branchless Logic Sandbox

This repository is a technical deep-dive into the world of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) via the Octra Network. It bridges the gap between high-level terminal interfaces and low-level cryptographic assembly, proving that we can compute complex logic on data that remains entirely encrypted.

The Vision: Privacy Without Compromise

In a standard blockchain, every transaction is a public book. With FHE, we imagine a world where the book is written in a language even the nodes cannot read, yet they can still perform calculations on its pages. This project explores Encrypted State Processing, the ability to evolve a system (like a game or a database) while the data stays locked behind a wall of math.

Why "Branchless"?

FHE nodes compute on encrypted ciphertexts. They cannot use if/else statements because they don't know the values they are comparing. To solve this, we implemented Branchless Mathematics, where logical flows are transformed into polynomial equations.

Traditional: if (cell_is_alive) { stay_alive }
FHE Math: NextState = Current \times IsAlive

What We Accomplished

1. The Async TUI (VS Code Environment)

We built a responsive, asynchronous terminal interface using Python's Textual library. It handles mock RPC communication with the Octra Devnet without blocking the UI, providing a real-time visualization of the encryption noise and network metrics.

2. The C++ Computation Engine

To simulate the heavy lifting of a "Circle" (Octra's smart contract model), we developed a C++ engine that executes Conway’s Game of Life using strictly branchless logic. This simulates the exact mathematical constraints of an FHE environment.

3. AppliedML & Rehovot Compilation (Webcli IDE)

We successfully ported our branchless logic into AppliedML, Octra’s native functional language. Using the local Rehovot compiler, we achieved:

Total Instructions: 35

Bytecode Size: 217 bytes of pure Octra Assembly (.oasm)

Encryption Testing: We used local FHE tools to encrypt integers into massive Base64 ciphertexts, proving the "Ciphertext Bloat" reality where a single bit becomes a 50KB+ string for security.

Faucet Reality & Local Simulation

While our networking bridge and bytecode are production-ready, the official Octra Devnet Faucet has been deprecated/discontinued. Without the required 0.2 OCT deployment fee, a public broadcast was not possible.

However, this limitation became a feature. This project evolved into a high-fidelity Local Sandbox. It proves that a developer can build, compile, and mathematically verify a privacy-preserving dApp entirely in a local environment, ready for the moment the network economics open up.

Setup & Execution

Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

C++17 Compiler (g++ or clang)

Octra Webcli (For local IDE & AppliedML tests)

Step 1: Run the Terminal & C++ Engine

# Compile the Branchless C++ Logic
cd circle_contract
g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp -o octra_gol
cd ..

# Start the Terminal UI
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh

Step 2: Test the Smart Contract (AppliedML)

To see the code we compiled into 217-byte assembly:

Run the official Octra webcli and open http://127.0.0.1:8420.

Copy the contents of circle_contract/FHEGameOfLife.aml.

Paste into the Dev Tools section and hit Compile.

The Future: What's Next?

If this project were fully funded with OCT tokens, it would transition from a sandbox to a Live Sentinel. We envision a decentralized guardian that processes sensitive sensor data or game states across the Octra network, where the "truth" is computed but the "data" is never revealed.

Note: This repository is for educational purposes, showcasing the intersection of TUI design, C++ performance, and cutting-edge FHE cryptography.
